        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>YWeb Career Academy (YWebCA) is a <strong>training program</strong> for people who are underrepresented in technology: women and people of color. The goal is get students ready for good, family-sustaining jobs, while meeting a gap in the labor market for these jobs. We provide instruction in front end web development skills including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, UX design, and project management.</p>

        <h2>How The Classes Work</h2>

        <p>Each cohort is 20–25 students. Each season is 400 hours of intensive instruction.</p>

        <p>Students learn in a "flipped classroom.” Lessons are provided online for them to study in preparation for classroom labs. These labs provide resources and additional instruction from industry leaders and volunteer mentors, which can include answering questions, troubleshooting, brainstorming ideas, and other work pertaining to the daily focus. Labs are held Monday through Thursday evenings to accommodate students life and family schedules.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Lab days follow a structure that allows for both work time and instruction from visiting guests. We begin with a stand-up: a chance to connect, share challenges, and make a plan for the work time. Sprints are held in "hot" and "cold" rooms, allowing for conversational collaboration or quiet work. Between the two daily sprints is a snack and office yoga break, supporting strong and healthy work habits. We end each lab session with a final standup to review the work accomplished that day.</p>
